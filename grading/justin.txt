2 - 1/1
3 - 1/1
4 - 1/1
5 - 1/1
6 - .5/1  -- A list in python needs to be in square brackets, with each element separated by commas
So "items" should be something like ["green key", "gold medal"], etc.
7 - 1/1
8 - .5/1  -- The variables need to be added to the list, not the text itself
9 - 1/1
10 - .5/1  -- To create an empty list, use [], not ""
11 - .5/1  -- Prompt function is incomplete
12 - .5/1  -- CheckLocked function is incomplete
13 - 1/1
14 - 0/1  -- You don't have a game loop here: basically you need:
while not done:
    #all of your IF statements should be inside here.
15 - 0/1  -- To call a function, just write it like so:
    command = Prompt()
16 - 1/1
17 - .5/1  -- for the Commands, it isn't enough to just say:
    if forward:
because Python doesn't know what "forward" is.  You have to compare the command they entered to "forward":
    if command == "Forward":
        #code here
18 - .5/1  -- similar issue here
19 - 0/1  -- and here - also, no option for the user to get, drop or say "something"
20 - 1/1
21 - 1/1

-1 for multiple syntax errors before I could get it running
