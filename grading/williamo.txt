1 - 0/1  -- The problem here is you are using "while True", which creates an un-ending loop.  Replace this with something like:
        for i in range(0,10):  (This will loop 10 times), and it should work properly, and let the rest of the game start.
2 - 1/1  -- Careful here - right now there are inside the animation loop, but we want them to happen after the loop ends (so they need to be un-indented)
3 - 1/1
4 - 1/1
5 - 1/1
6 - 1/1
7 - 1/1
8 - 0/1  -- The items the user entered are not added in
9 - 1/1
10 - 1/1
11 - 0/1  -- No "Prompt" function
12 - 0/1  -- Or a "CheckLocked" function
13 - 1/1
14 - 1/1
15 - 1/1  -- (No "Prompt" function, but OK)
16 - 1/1
17 - 0/1  -- So, a couple things here:
    You need to update the "current" variable, you can use this line right at the beginning of the loop:
        current = room_numbers[cRow][cCol]
    And to check if a room is locked, you first have to look up the room you are checking in the room_numbers table as well.
18 - 1/1
19 - 1/1  -- For "Take", it wasn't working since it was:
    if command[:3] == "Take":   --- But that compares only the first three letters, and "Take" has 4.
    if command[:4] == "Take":   --- This works fine
